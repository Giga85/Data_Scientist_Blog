### Project Motivation
This is the first project of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

It is a chance for me to practice what I am learning the Data Scientists course.

In this project, I will explore the Seattle Airbnb Data to answer some business questions:

 1. What is the average price per night by Year, Month or Weekday?
  
 2. What are the busiest month of the year?
  
 3. What kind of rooms are there and how many room are there in each?
  
 4. What are the average price of room types?
  
 5. What kind of properties are there and how many propertis are there in each?
  
 6. What are the average prices for the different room and property types?
  
 7. What are the average prices for the different room types and weekday?
